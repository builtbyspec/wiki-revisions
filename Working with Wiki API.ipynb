Its purpose is to introduce students to the campus and the community and prepare them for a successful college career. Freshmen are placed in a group with 10–12 other new students while transfer students are in groups of 40-60; each group is led by two current Cal Poly student orientation leaders.  The \"WOW\" groups participate in an array of orientation events in addition to activities both on- and off-campus. In 2010, the awareness section of the program won the 2010 National Orientation Directors Association (NODAC) Media & Publications Showcase Award in the Emerging Technologies. The awareness section was entirely developed by student volunteers. The program started in 1956 and is now the largest volunteer orientation program in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mustangdaily.net/history-of-wow-by-kristy-gonzalez |title=History of WOW |accessdate=October 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920023153/http://mustangdaily.net/history-of-wow-by-kristy-gonzalez/ |archivedate=September 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n",
